# CPU_SCHEDULING_SIMULATOR_PROJECT
This project is a web-based simulator designed to visually demonstrate various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It aims to help students and developers understand and compare how different algorithms handle process scheduling based on factors like burst time, arrival time, and priority.
